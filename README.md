# Library 

This was `library`, the [*8th project*](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) within the Odin Project curriculum and the 1st one in the JavaScript course. This was a project that made students utilise object constructors to organize their code and create a fully fledged library to track read and unread books.
